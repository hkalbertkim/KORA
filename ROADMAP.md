# Roadmap

This roadmap defines the practical evolution of KORA.

It is implementation-focused, not speculative.

---

## Current State - v0.1

KORA v0.1 includes:

- Task IR specification
- DAG-based execution
- Deterministic-first processing
- Budget governance
- Schema validation
- Reasoning adapter abstraction
- Telemetry instrumentation
- Break-even modeling
- Benchmark baseline

The architecture is structurally complete.

---

## v0.2 - Structural Refinement

Focus:

- Optimize structural overhead
- Improve deterministic coverage detection
- Improve DAG validation efficiency
- Strengthen telemetry performance
- Harden schema enforcement edge cases

Goals:

- Reduce O in break-even inequality
- Reduce latency variance
- Improve test coverage completeness

---

## v0.3 - Routing Intelligence

Focus:

- Policy-based routing engine
- Multi-model integration
- Cost-aware routing decisions
- Dynamic backend selection
- Escalation refinement

Goals:

- Reduce model-bound work
- Enable lightweight local reasoning
- Preserve compute neutrality

---

## v0.4 - Distributed Execution Prototype

Focus:

- Orchestrator-node protocol
- Node capability advertisement
- Failure isolation testing
- Telemetry aggregation across nodes
- Routing under partial failure

Goals:

- Demonstrate atomic distributed execution
- Validate failure containment
- Preserve invariants under distribution

---

## v0.5 - Structural Performance Validation

Focus:

- Large dataset benchmarking
- Latency distribution modeling
- Retry pattern analysis
- Overhead quantification at scale

Goals:

- Validate performance model predictions
- Refine break-even boundaries
- Publish empirical results

---

## v0.6 - DNFM Experimental Integration

Focus:

- Structured prompt segmentation experiments
- Task-scoped reasoning evaluation
- Budget-aware reasoning tests
- Model boundary isolation experiments

Goals:

- Evaluate feasibility of decomposition-native models
- Measure coherence under segmentation
- Publish experimental findings

---

## Long-Term Direction

If structural claims hold under scale:

- Distributed CPU cloud experimentation
- Edge-device participation
- Task-level compute marketplace
- Decomposition-native model collaboration

If structural claims fail:

- Refine decomposition granularity
- Optimize structural overhead
- Re-evaluate routing assumptions

Architecture must evolve under evidence.

---

## Invariants Across All Versions

The following must remain intact:

- Determinism before inference
- Budget as contract
- Schema validation enforcement
- Task atomicity
- Routing neutrality

Version upgrades must preserve these invariants.

---

## Closing Position

KORA evolves through disciplined iteration.

Each version must:

- Preserve structure
- Improve measurability
- Reduce hidden inference
- Strengthen architectural clarity

Structure is not negotiable.

Scale follows structure.
