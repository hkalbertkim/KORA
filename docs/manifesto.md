# KORA Manifesto

LLMs should not be called by default.

Intelligence must be structured before it is scaled.

Inference should be bounded.
Execution should be deterministic when possible.
Outputs must be verifiable.

KORA exists to shift AI from
"always infer"
to
"infer only when necessary."

Structure first.
Inference second.
