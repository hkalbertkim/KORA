# The KORA Manifesto

Modern AI systems reason too easily.

Every request becomes a prompt.<br>
Every prompt becomes inference.<br>
Every inference becomes cost.<br>

This is convenient.

It is not disciplined.

---

## 1. We Reject Inference Reflex

Intelligence does not mean invoking a model.

We reject the assumption that every input deserves probabilistic reasoning.

Some problems are structural.<br>
Some problems are deterministic.<br>
Some problems require no model at all.<br>

**Reason only when necessary.**

---

## 2. We Believe Structure Precedes Scale

Scaling inference without structure amplifies fragility.

More tokens.<br>
More latency.<br>
More centralization.<br>
More opacity.<br>

Structure introduces boundaries.<br>
Boundaries introduce control.<br>
Control makes intelligence sustainable.<br>

**Structure first. Scale second.**

---

## 3. We Decompose by Default

Monolithic prompts hide structure.<br>
Hidden structure cannot be governed.<br>

We make structure explicit.<br>
Every complex request must be decomposed into atomic tasks.<br>
Reasoning is not eliminated. It is isolated.<br>

Isolation enables clarity.<br>
Clarity enables discipline.<br>

---

## 4. We Treat Budget as Contract

Unbounded inference is architectural negligence.

Every model call must be constrained.

- Tokens are finite.
- Time is finite.
- Retries are finite.

Inference is powerful.<br>
Power must be bounded.

---

## 5. We Validate Before We Trust

Model output is probabilistic.<br>
Trust must be earned through structure.

Every output must satisfy explicit schema.<br>
Every task must be verifiable.<br>
Every failure must be visible.<br>

No silent drift.<br>
No implicit trust.<br>

---

## 6. We Refuse Hardware Absolutism

Compute is substrate, not authority.

Intelligence must not depend on a single hardware class.

CPU is first-class.<br>
Small models are first-class.<br>
Distributed nodes are first-class.<br>

Heterogeneity is not weakness.<br>
It is resilience.<br>

---

## 7. We Design for Measurability

Claims must be falsifiable.

If decomposition does not reduce invocation, we measure it.<br>
If overhead exceeds savings, we acknowledge it.<br>
If structure fails under scale, we revise it.<br>

Architecture must survive experiment.

---

## 8. We Separate Convenience from Discipline

Reflexive systems are easier to build.<br>
Structured systems are harder to erode.<br>

Convenience scales quickly.<br>
Discipline scales safely.<br>

We choose discipline.

---

## 9. We Build for the Long Term

Models will grow larger.<br>
Tokens will grow cheaper.<br>
Hardware will evolve.<br>

Structure remains relevant.

When models become stronger, discipline becomes more important, not less.

---

## 10. We Do Not Compete on Model Size

KORA does not attempt to outscale models.

It governs their invocation.<br>
It is not another model.<br>
It is an execution architecture.<br>

---

## Closing Statement

KORA is a refusal.

A refusal to treat intelligence as reflex.<br>
A refusal to scale without structure.<br>
A refusal to centralize by default.<br>

It is a commitment to discipline in execution.

**Reason deliberately.  
Structure explicitly.  
Scale responsibly.**
