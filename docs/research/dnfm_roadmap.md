# Decomposition-Native Foundation Model (Future Direction)

KORA does not currently train a foundation model.

Future direction:

- Decompose tasks natively
- Route subcomponents to different execution engines
- Enable heterogeneous compute environments
- Reduce GPU dependency

DNFM is an architectural trajectory, not a current implementation.
