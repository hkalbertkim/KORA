# Krako Cloud Product Positioning v1.0

Status: Strategic Positioning Document  
Language: English (Official Document)  
Purpose: Define the positioning, differentiation, and relationship between KORA Studio (local execution) and Krako Cloud (distributed execution infrastructure).

---

# 1. Positioning Overview

KORA Studio and Krako Cloud are not competing products.
They are two layers of the same execution architecture.

• KORA Studio = Local Execution Intelligence  
• Krako Cloud = Distributed Execution Infrastructure

KORA Studio proves structural efficiency.  
Krako Cloud scales structured execution.

---

# 2. Core Differentiation

## 2.1 KORA Studio

Primary Identity:

• Deterministic-first local AI runtime  
• Personal execution OS  
• Developer-friendly structured inference engine  
• Fully local and self-contained

Key Characteristics:

• Runs on a single machine  
• Uses local CPU/GPU  
• Zero infrastructure dependency  
• No billing required  
• Advanced telemetry visibility

Studio is about discipline and transparency.

---

## 2.2 Krako Cloud

Primary Identity:

• Scalable execution fabric  
• Multi-node distributed runtime  
• High-capacity LLM execution layer  
• Production-grade infrastructure

Key Characteristics:

• Large-model support (beyond local VRAM limits)  
• High concurrency  
• Autoscaling  
• Global execution regions  
• Usage-based billing  
• SLA & enterprise features

Cloud is about scale and reliability.

---

# 3. User Journey

## Stage 1 – Local Exploration

User installs KORA Studio.

• Experiments locally  
• Builds structured applications  
• Sees deterministic savings  
• Understands TaskGraph execution

No cost, no cloud dependency.

---

## Stage 2 – Resource Boundary Encountered

User hits limits:

• Model too large  
• Concurrency too high  
• Latency unacceptable  
• Long-running reasoning required

Studio suggests optional upgrade.

---

## Stage 3 – Hybrid Execution

User enables Krako Cloud backend.

Execution flow:

User → KORA → Krako Cloud

Structure remains identical.
Only substrate changes.

---

# 4. Messaging Framework

## Studio Messaging

"Run powerful structured AI locally."

Emphasize:

• Control  
• Transparency  
• Deterministic-first efficiency  
• No hidden inference  
• No vendor lock-in

---

## Cloud Messaging

"Scale structured AI beyond local limits."

Emphasize:

• Large model access  
• Distributed compute  
• Performance under load  
• Enterprise readiness  
• Infrastructure reliability

---

# 5. Comparative Table

| Dimension | KORA Studio | Krako Cloud |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Execution Scope | Single machine | Distributed cluster |
| Model Size | Limited by local hardware | Large-scale models |
| Concurrency | Low | High |
| Cost | Local hardware only | Usage-based |
| Telemetry | Local-only | Global session-level |
| Autoscaling | No | Yes |
| Trust & Billing | No | Yes |

---

# 6. Revenue Alignment

Revenue is tied to scale, not structure.

KORA Studio remains open and free.
Krako Cloud monetizes:

• High-performance execution  
• Multi-user workloads  
• Large model access  
• Enterprise integration

This preserves ecosystem growth while enabling infrastructure revenue.

---

# 7. Strategic Narrative

The architectural narrative must remain consistent:

Structure precedes scale.

KORA provides structure.
Krako provides scale.

Cloud does not replace Studio.
Cloud extends Studio.

---

# 8. Investor & Enterprise Framing

For enterprise stakeholders:

KORA = Execution Standard  
Krako Cloud = Infrastructure Platform

The combination delivers:

• Predictable cost models  
• Deterministic governance  
• Reduced GPU dependency  
• Horizontal scalability  
• Structured execution transparency

---

# 9. Long-Term Strategic Position

If KORA becomes a widely adopted execution standard:

Krako Cloud becomes:

• The most optimized fabric for KORA workloads  
• The reference scalable implementation  
• The revenue-generating execution layer

The positioning must reinforce that Cloud optimizes scale, not intelligence.

---

# Final Position

KORA Studio empowers local structured intelligence.
Krako Cloud empowers scalable structured execution.

Structure is universal.
Scale is optional and monetized.
